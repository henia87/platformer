## Line ending normalization
##
## Goal: keep the repository consistent (LF) across platforms, while allowing
## Windows-native scripts to stay CRLF.

# Normalize all detected text files to LF in the repo.
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicit: keep Husky scripts LF (shell scripts).
.husky/* text eol=lf

# Windows scripts should remain CRLF.
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# Common binary assets (do not attempt EOL conversion).
